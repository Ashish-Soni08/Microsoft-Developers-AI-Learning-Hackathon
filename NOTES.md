# LEARNING JOURNEY: Azure Cosmos DB Developer Cloud Skills Challenge

##  PART 1: Azure Cosmos DB Developer Cloud Skills Challenge

### Getting Started with Azure OpenAI Service

To build applications that utilize the capabilities you see in ChatGPT(a chtbot build by OpenAI) that takes in natural language input from a user and returns a machine created, human like response, we need generative AI models that power ChatGPT's ablity to produce new content such as text, code and images based on natural language prompts. Many generative AI models are a subset of deep learning algorithms. These algorithms support various workloads across vision, speech, language, decision, search, and more.

`Azure OpenAI` Service brings these generative AI models to the Azure platform, enabling you to develop powerful AI solutions that benefit from the security, scalability, and integration of other services provided by the Azure cloud platform. These models are available for building applications through a REST API, various SDKs, and a Studio interface.

### Explore fundamentals of Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB is a highly scalable cloud database service for NoSQL data. It provides a global-scale database solution for non-relational data.

### Introduction to building copilots for startups

A copilot is an application that uses modern AI and large language models to assist you with a complex cognitive task.
Copilots are AI-powered assistants or conversational agents that understand user intent and help complete various tasks or provide relevant information.

### Build natural language solutions with Azure OpenAI Service

Azure OpenAI provides a platform for developers to add artificial intelligence functionality to their applications with the help of both Python and C# SDKs and REST APIs. The platform has various AI models available, each specializing in different tasks, which can be deployed through the Azure OpenAI Service
